    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>
        <p>TeneT is a place for posting bundles of text, either in the form of blog posts, humble attemps at storytelling, informative writings as well as potentially devlog entries.</p>
        <p>I will mainly share my fabricated stories and informative writings/devlogs, in a measle attempt to try and give you guys some good influence in this world of adversity.</p>
        <p>This website is very barebones as of now, as I am not familiar with css, html nor javascript. That said I do plan on improving the look of this as I gain more experience.</p>
